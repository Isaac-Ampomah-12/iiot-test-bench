## General Info

The heart of a IIoT solution is a message broker. Several technologies are available here,  
e.g. MQTT-Broker, Microsoft Azure IoT Hub or Kafka. The risk is that we do not know the limits of these systems in productive use.  
These include performance and load with a very large number of messages, publishing large amounts of data via the broker and  
networks, persistence, security and compression of IoT data. This project seeks to test and visualize IIoT brokers performance in a dashboard.
